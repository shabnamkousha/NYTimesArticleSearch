# NYTimesArticleSearch

New York Times News Search article app which allows a user to find old articles

Time Spent: 17 hours

- User can enter a search query that will display a grid of news articles using the thumbnail and headline from the New York Times Search API.
- User can click on "settings" which allows selection of advanced search options to filter results. 
    * User can configure advanced search filters such as:Begin Date News desk values and Sort order.
- Subsequent searches will have any filters applied to the search results.
- User does not need to reenter the filters value everytime goes to setting page.
- User can tap on any article in results to view the contents in an embedded browser.
- User can scroll down "infinitely" to continue loading more news articles. 

Hints:
- The refactor/Move drag and drop doesn't work on my Anroid Studio on mac. Need to fix the issue to reorganize the files.
